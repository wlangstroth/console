# console

Trading console for OANDA's API, made with SDL. And love. But mostly SDL.


## Configuration

Haven't set up real configuration yet, so it's just a file called "secrets.h".


## Warning

Avert your eyes. I have no intention of making this code pleasing to others. It's up on github as a backup.

Seriously, ugliest code. There's cut and paste all over the place, and I don't care.
